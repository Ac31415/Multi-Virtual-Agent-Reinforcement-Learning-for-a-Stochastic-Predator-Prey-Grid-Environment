# Multi-Virtual-Agent-Reinforcement-Learning-for-a-Stochastic-Predator-Prey-Grid-Environment

This code provides a Q learning approach to optimize a simplified microgrid (energy arbitrage) setup. This code contributes to the reference paper below, which describes a more complex setup of aggregating multiple learning agents for microgrid energy optimization during extreme weather events.
